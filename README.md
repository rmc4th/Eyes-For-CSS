# Eyes-For-CSS
Repository of MITxPro Coding Cohort Week 8 Project
___

#Description

## Purpose
Apply CSS techniques to create a desired layout

## Background
This project was a weekly exercise for the MITxPro coding cohort.

Cohort was given a basic HTML page that contained a single "eye" object that "followed" movement of the mouse.

Cohort was tasked to modify the html page and apply styles that would create a centered tow-eyed image.

## Project

This project required the cohort:

1. Create an HTML element ("eyes") that encapsulated two "eye" elements
2. Write styles for the "eyes" element that centers the set of "eye"s in the window.

Additionally, the styles were moved to a separate stylesheet ("eyes.css")

## Repository
The following files are contained in this repository.
1. index.html - Main HTML document: Buttons to add images and start movement
2. eyes.cds - Javascript code for responding to HTML buttons, managing crreation and movement of images, manipulation of the DOM to display the images.

# Installation
The resulting code was tested on Google Chrome. Once loaded and once mouse movement is detected in the window, the eyes track the mouse movement.

# Support
For questions contact rmc4th@yahoo.com

# Roadmap
For future revisions, the code could be reworked to stop and to restart the eye movement tracking the mouse.
